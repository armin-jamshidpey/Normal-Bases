\section{Basis Conversion}

\textbf{Normal to Power basis}
Suppose $G = \lbrace g_1, \ldots, g_n \rbrace$, $\alpha$ is a normal element of $K$ and $u = \begin{bmatrix}u_1 & \ldots & u_n \end{bmatrix} \in F^n$ is given as the coefficient vector of $u$ in the normal basis.
In order to write $u $ in the power basis one can compute 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:norm2pwrmat}
\left[\begin{array}{c|c|c}
\overline{g_1(\alpha)} & \cdots & \overline{g_n(\alpha)} 
\end{array}\right]\cdot 
\begin{bmatrix}
u_1 & \cdots & u_n
\end{bmatrix}^t,
\end{equation}
where $\overline{g_i(\alpha)}$ is the coefficient vector of $g_i(\alpha)$. The result of \eqref{eq:norm2pwrmat} is the coefficient vector of
\begin{equation}\label{eq:norm2pwrpol}
\sum_{i = 1}^n u_i g_i(\alpha).
\end{equation}
Note that \eqref{eq:norm2pwrmat} shows that conversion from normal to power basis is transpose of the problem of computing the projections of 
conjugates of $\alpha$ which is solved in Section \label{sec:osum}. Here we present an explicit algorithm to solve this problem i.e. to compute
\eqref{eq:norm2pwrpol} for abelian and metacyclic $G$.
