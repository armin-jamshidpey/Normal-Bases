\section{Basis Conversion}\label{sec:conversion}

We conclude this paper with algorithms for basis conversion: assuming
we know that $\alpha$ is normal, we show how to perform the
change-of-basis between the power basis of $\K/\F$ and the normal
basis $G\cdot \alpha$. The techniques used below are inspired by 
those used by~\cite[Section~4]{KalSho98} in the case of extensions
of finite fields.

\subsection{From normal to power basis} Suppose $G = \lbrace g_1, \ldots, g_n
\rbrace$, $\alpha$ is a normal element of $\K/\F$ and we are given $u\in \K$ 
as $u=\sum_{i=1}^n u_i g_i(\alpha)$. In order to write
$u $ in the power basis, we have to compute the matrix-vector 
product
\begin{equation}\label{eq:norm2pwrmat}
\left[\begin{array}{ccc}
\boldsymbol \gamma_1 & \cdots & \boldsymbol \gamma_n 
\end{array}\right]\cdot 
\begin{bmatrix}
u_1 \\ \vdots \\ u_n
\end{bmatrix},
\end{equation}
where for $i=1,\dots,n$, $\boldsymbol \gamma_i \in \F^{n\times 1}$ is
the coefficient vector of $g_i(\alpha)$. As already pointed out by
Kaltofen and Shoup, this shows that conversion from normal to power
basis is the transpose problem of computing the ``projected'' orbit
sum $s_{\alpha,\ell}$, which we solved in Section \ref{sec:osum}. 

The transposition principle would then allow us to derive runtime
estimates for the conversion problem; below, we present explicit
procedures to solve this problem for abelian and metacyclic~$G$.

\paragraph{Abelian extensions.} Under Assumption \ref{assum}, suppose $G$
is given by \eqref{eq:abeliangrp}, $\alpha$ is a normal element and $u
= \begin{bmatrix} u_1 \cdots u_n \end{bmatrix}^t \in F^n$ is an
element of $K$. Moreover, let $\prod s_i = O(\lceil \sqrt{n}
\rceil)$. The basis conversion from normal to power basis is
equivalent of computing \eqref{eq:norm2pwrpol} and the later problem
can be solved in three steps. Before presenting the algorithm, note
that \eqref{eq:norm2pwrpol} can be written as
$$\sum_{\substack{1 \leq j \leq r\\ 0 \leq i_j < e_j}} u_{i_1 \cdots
  i_r} g_1^{i_1} \cdots g_r^{i_r}(\alpha) = \sum_{\substack{1 \leq j
    \leq r\\ 0 \leq i_j \leq s_j}} \overline{g_1}^{i_1} \cdots
\overline{g_r}^{i_r} (h_{i_1 \cdots i_r}),$$ where $$h_{i_1 \cdots
  i_r} = \sum_{\substack{1 \leq k \leq r\\ 0 \leq j_k < s_k}} u^{(i_1
  \cdots i_r)}_{j_1 \cdots j_r} g_1^{j_1} \cdots g_r^{j_r}(\alpha)$$
and $\overline{g_j} = g_j^{s_j}$.

\smallskip\noindent\textbf{Step 1.} We begin the process by
computing $$g_1^{i_1} \cdots g_r^{i_r}(\alpha), \, 1 \leq j \leq r, 0
\leq i_j \leq s_i.$$ Using Lemma \ref{lem:selfcomp}, this can be done
using $\osumcosttilde$ operations in $F$.

\smallskip\noindent\textbf{Step 2.} In order to get $h_{i_1 \cdots
  i_r}$ multiply the matrix with rows $g_1^{i_1} \cdots
g_r^{i_r}(\alpha)$ by the matrix with columns the coefficients of
$h_{i_1 \cdots i_r}$. This operation can be done in $O(n^{1/2 \cdot
  \omega(2)})$.

\smallskip\noindent\textbf{Step 3.} Use Lemma \ref{lem:hornerrep} to
compute \eqref{eq:norm2pwrpol}.

\paragraph{Metacyclic extension.} with the same assumptions as in the
abelian case, suppose $G$ is given by \eqref{eq:metacyclic}. In this
case \eqref{eq:norm2pwrpol} can be rewritten as
$$\sum_{i = 0}^m \sum_{0}^s u_{ij}\sigma^i \tau^j(\alpha) = \sum_{i =
  0}^{\lceil \sqrt{m} \rceil} \overline{\sigma}^i(h_i),$$ where $h_i =
\sum_{j = 0}^{\sqrt{m}/\sqrt{s}}\sum_{k =0}^{s} a_{jk}^{(i)}\sigma^j
\tau^k (\alpha)$ and $\overline{\sigma} = \sigma^{\lceil \sqrt{ms}
  \rceil}$.  Note that without loss of generality we can assume $s
\leq m$. Similar to the abelian case, we can do the computation in
three steps.

\smallskip\noindent\textbf{Step 1.} Compute $\sigma^i\tau^j(\alpha)$
for $0 \leq i \leq \lceil \sqrt{m} /\sqrt{s} \rceil$ and $0 \leq j <
s$.  Using Lemma \ref{lem:selfcomp}, this can be done using
$\osumcosttilde$ operations in $F$.

\smallskip\noindent\textbf{Step 2.} In order to get $h_{i}$ multiply
the matrix with rows $\sigma^i\tau^j(\alpha)$ by the matrix with
columns the coefficients of $h_{i}$. This operation can be done in
$O((ms)^{1/2 \cdot \omega(2)})$.

\smallskip\noindent\textbf{Step 3.} Use Lemma \ref{lem:hornerrep} to
compute \eqref{eq:norm2pwrpol}.

\subsection{Power basis to normal basis.}

Now assume $u \in K$ is given in power basis. The goal is to find $c_i$'s in $F$ such that, 
$$u = \sum_{i = 0}^{n-1} c_i g_i(\alpha).$$
Then for any element $g_j$ of $G$ we have
$$g_j(u) = \sum_{i = 0}^{n-1} c_i g_jg_i(\alpha).$$
On the other hand if $l$ is a random projection of $K$ to $F$, we get 
$$l(g_j(u)) = \sum_{i = 0}^{n-1} c_i l(g_jg_i(\alpha)).$$
Hence, in order to find $c_i$'s it is enough to solve the linear system
\begin{equation}\label{eq:convlinsys}
l(M_G(\alpha)) \textbf{x} = \begin{bmatrix} l(g_i(u)) \end{bmatrix}_{0 \leq i <n}
\end{equation}
Hence the conversion problem can be solved in 2 steps 

\smallskip\noindent\textbf{Step 1.} compute $\begin{bmatrix} l(g_i(u)) \end{bmatrix}_{0 \leq i <n}$ which can be done using
the algorithms of Section \ref{sec:osum}. This can be carried out using $\thecost$ operations in $F$.

\smallskip\noindent\textbf{Step 2.} compute $l(M_G(\alpha))$ and then solving the linear system \eqref{eq:convlinsys}.

\paragraph{Abelian extension.}
It is already mentioned that multiplying by $l(M_G(\alpha))$ is equivalent of multiplication in a multivariate ring, by 
$s_{\alpha, \ell}$. Hence by considering the group algebra version of \eqref{eq:convlinsys} we have to solve $$s_{\alpha,\ell} x 
= s_u$$ for $x$ 
in $F[G]$. This can be done by using the tools provided in Section ?. Computing the inverse of $s_{\alpha,\ell}$ costs the same 
as testing its invertiblity. Having the inverse we get the solution with a single multiplication in $F[G]$.

\paragraph{Metacyclic extension.}

In order to solve \eqref{eq:convlinsys}, in the metacyclic case, we start with understanding the structure of $M_G(\alpha)$. 
Assume the first row of $M_G(\alpha)$ is 
$$\begin{bmatrix}
\sigma^0 \tau^0 &  \cdots & \sigma^{n-1} \tau^0 & \sigma^0 \tau &  \cdots & \sigma^{n-1} \tau & \sigma^0 \tau^s &  \cdots & 
\sigma^{n-1} \tau^s 
\end{bmatrix}$$
Now by considering the actions (respectively) of
$$\tau^0 \sigma^1, \ldots , \tau^0 \sigma^{n-1}, \tau^1 \sigma^0, \ldots , \tau^1 \sigma^{n-1} , \cdots \tau^s \sigma^0, \ldots 
, \tau^s \sigma^{n-1}$$
on the first row we get $M_G(\alpha)$.
Note that here we are using both presentation of elements in $G$ as $\sigma^i\tau^j$ and $\tau^j\sigma^i$. Using above argument 
it is not hard to see $M_G(\alpha)$ as a block matrix with blocks generated by the action of $\tau^l \sigma^1, \ldots , \tau^l 
\sigma^{n-1}$ on $\sigma^0 \tau^k ,  \ldots , \sigma^{n-1} \tau^k$. In other word the $lk$-th block of $M$ is 
$\left( \tau^l \sigma^{(i-1)+(j-1)} \tau^k \right)_{ij}$ for $1 \leq i,j \leq n$. This shows that each block is a Hankel $n \times n$ matrix.
