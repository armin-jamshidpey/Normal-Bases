\section{Introduction}

For a finite Galois extension $K/F$ with $G = \mathrm{Gal}(K/F)$, an
element $\alpha \in K$ is called \emph{normal} if the set of Galois
conjugates of $\alpha$ forms a basis for $K$ as a vector space over
$F$. The existence of normal element for any finite Galois extension is
known for a long time.
 
There is a wide range of applications of normal bases in finite
fields. Fast exponentiation or computing the action of the Frobenius and
point counting on elliptic curves are some of their applications. There are
also applications of normal elements in characteristic zero. For example,
for a given permutation lattice and appropriate Galois extension a normal
basis is useful in computing the multiplicative invariants explicitly (see
\cite{Armin} for more details).

There are a number of available algorithms for finding a normal element in
characteristic zero fields and finite fields.  Because of their immediate
applications in finite fields, algorithms for determining normal elements
in this case has seen the most activity.  A fast randomized algorithems for
determining a normal element in a finite field $\FF_{q^n}$ with $q^n$
elements (for any prime power $q$ and integer $n>1$), is presented by
\citeN{Giesbrecht} with a cost of $O(n^2+n\log q)$.  A faster randomized
algorithm is introduced by \citeN{Kaltofen}, with a cost of $O(n^{1.8})$
operations in $\FF_q$.  \citeN{LenstraNormal} introduced a
deterministic algorithm to construct a normal element which uses
$O(n^{O(1)})$ operations in $\FF_q$.  To the best of our knowledge, the
algorithm of \citeN{AugCam??} is the most efficient
deterministic method, with a cost of $O(n^3+n^2\log q)$ operations in
$\FF_q$.

In characteristic zero, \citeN{Poli} gives an algorithm for abelian
extensions in with $O(n^{O(1)})$.  \citeN{Stepanov} introduce an algorithm
in the cyclic case with $O(n^{O(1)})$ as the computation cost.
\citeN{Girstmair} gives an algorithm which requires $O(n^4)$ operations
over the base field to construct a normal element for a general finite
Galois extension in characteristic zero.

In this paper we will introduce a randomized algorithm for finding a normal
element in case of abelian and metacyclic extensions which is subquadratic
in the degree of the extension. The idea behind the algorithm is similar to
ideas in \cite{Giesbrecht,Kaltofen}. Since one of the of the assumptions in the
results of this paper is the same, we state it here for future references .

\begin{assumption}
  \label{assum}
  $K/F$ is a finite Galois extension given by $ F[x]/f$ for an irreducible
  polynomial $f\in F[x]$ of degree $n$, with $G =
  \mathrm{Gal}(K/F)$. Moreover $\alpha$ is an element of $K$ and the action
  of generators of $ G$, such as $g$, on $K$ is given by its action on
  $\bar{x} = x \mod f.$ In other words, $g(\bar{x})$ is given for any
  generator $g$ of $G$.
\end{assumption}

\begin{remark}
  With the above assumption, suppose
  $$\beta = \sum_{0\leq i \leq n-1} a_i \bar{x}^i \in F[\bar{x}]$$. For any
  $g \in G$ and integer $t,$ we have
\begin{equation}\label{rmk:comute}
g^t(\beta) = \sum_{0\leq i \leq n-1} a_i g^t(\bar{x}^i) = \beta(g^t(\bar{x}))
\end{equation}
since $g$ acts trivially on $a_i$.
\end{remark}

Under the Assumption \ref{assum} we choose a random element $\alpha$ of
$K$. We use a known fact that, $\alpha$ is normal if
$M_G(\alpha) \in M_{n\times n}(K)$, an associated matrix to $\alpha$ (see
Section 2 for the definition), is invertible.  Afterwards we reduce the
invertiblity of $M_G(\alpha)$ to invertiblity of a random projection an
associated element $\osum{G}{K} \in K[G]$ which lies in $F[G]$, the group
ring of $G$ over $F$.

Section \ref{sec:pre} of this paper is devoted to provide the definitions
and preliminary discussions. In Section \ref{sec:osum} the orbit sum
problem is discussed and two algorithms are presented which can be applied
to compute projections of orbit sums.  Finally in the last section we do
what?!
