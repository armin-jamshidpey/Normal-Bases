For any finite Galois field extension K/F, with Galois group G = Gal(K/F), there exists an element α ∈ K whose orbit G · α forms an F-basis of K. Such an α is called a normal element and G · α is a normal basis. We introduce a probabilistic algorithm for finding a normal element when G is either a finite abelian or a metacyclic group. The algorithm is based on the fact that deciding whether a random element α ∈ K is normal can be reduced to deciding whether Σ σ(α)σ ∈ K[G] is invertible (where σ ranges over all of G).  Our algorithm requires a quadratic number of operations in the size of G for metacyclic G, and a slightly subquadratic number of operations for abelian G.
